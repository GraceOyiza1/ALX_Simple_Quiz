# ALX Simple Interactive Quiz

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is an implementation of a basic client-side quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to make the static quiz structure interactive, allowing the user to select an answer and receive immediate feedback on whether their choice was correct or incorrect.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives Achieved
* **DOM Manipulation:** Used `document.querySelector` and `document.getElementById` to retrieve user input and update the feedback element.
* **Event Handling:** Added a click event listener to the "Submit Answer" button to trigger the validation logic.
* **Conditional Logic:** Implemented an `if/else` statement to compare the user's answer against the correct answer (`"4"`).
